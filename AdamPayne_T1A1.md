**Q12**

After writing out the ruby code from question 12 the first attempt at running it
produced the following error.

```q12.rb:2:in '<main>': undefined method '/' for...```


Changing line one from "celsius = gets" to "celsius = gets.to_f" produced the
correct output. The gets method recives the users input saved as the variable
celcius. When the user enters a number the gets method receives from standard
input a string. The calculation on line 2 can not be done to strings. The
method to_f returns the result of gets as a floating point number which will
allow the calculaton to run and prevent any rounding errors that would have been
produced by to_i.
